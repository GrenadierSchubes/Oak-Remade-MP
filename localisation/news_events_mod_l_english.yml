She is not alone! She has a great empire behind her! Together with the British Empire, she can form a bloc that controls the seas and continue the struggle. This war is not over as a result of the Battle of France. Vanquished today by mechanical force, in the future we will be able to overcome by a superior mechanical force. The fate of the world depends on it.' This appeal serves as the essential legal basis of de Gaulle's government in exile, that the armistice soon to be signed with the Nazis is not merely dishonourable but illegal, and that in signing it, and the French government has committed treason."
