 HOL_obtain_foreign_colonial_investments_desc:0 "Though they are strongly anti-colonialist, the Americans have nevertheless long had an economic interest in our colonies, in particular the West Indies. Along with the British and the Japanese, they yearn to make investments in our colonial development, both in the West as in the East. We should encourage this."
 HOL_obtain_foreign_colonial_investments_tt:0 "These allow for temporary bonuses to §YConsumer Goods§! and §YConstruction Speed§!, as well as permanent increases in §YOil§! production in the East and West Indies.\n"
 HOL_the_western_possessions:0 "The Western Possessions"
 HOL_the_western_possessions_desc:0 "The West Indies are often overlooked in favor of their Eastern counterparts, but they are rich in resources of their own. Assuring the infrastructure is adequate is the first step towards potentially increasing the industry and resource extraction in the area."
 HOL_expand_curacao_oil_refineries:0 "Expand Curaçao Oil Refineries"
 HOL_expand_curacao_oil_refineries_desc:0 "Owing to the shallow depth of Lake Maracaibo, since 1918 virtually all Venezuelan oil is instead shipped by shallow-draft coastal transport to be processed on Aruba and Curaçao, and from there shipped across the world in ocean-going tankers. Our refineries there are currently already the largest in the world, but the upcoming world crisis might well warrant even further expansion of the facilities."

 HOL_open_second_paranam_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Bauxite from Suriname is of tremendous importance to the production of aluminum for the major powers' airplane industries. With the current military build-up around the world the demand for aluminum has increased dramatically, and we could therefore undoubtedly increase our exports if we were to open a second bauxite mine in Paranam."
 HOL_antilles_defenses:0 "Antilles Defenses"
 HOL_antilles_defenses_desc:0 "Considering the huge importance of our oil refineries on Aruba and Curaçao, it is not strange that foreign parties with a vested interest in them seem very nervous about the weak state of our defenses here. If we want to avoid these parties feeling the need to defend the islands for us, perhaps we should see to improving the defenses ourselves..."

 HOL_pre_empt_venezuelan_aggression:0 "Pre-Empt Venezuelan Aggression"
 HOL_pre_empt_venezuelan_aggression_desc:0 "The Venezuelans have made their designs on our Antilles more than clear. They may have tried to simply 'offer their protection' this time around, but there is no telling what they might be driven to if our situation should deteriorate. We must strike before they do, and ensure the security of our oil refineries."
 HOL_the_crown_jewel_colony:0 "The Crown Jewel Colony"
 HOL_the_crown_jewel_colony_desc:0 "As India is to the British, so are the East Indies to us. However, the current, out-dated infrastructure in the East Indies simply will not do in this modern age. Our National Pride must be treated as such, and so the infrastructure shall be modernized to bring it more in line with what is expected of such an important part of our nation."
 HOL_jav:0 "Leopoldville"
 HOL_jav_desc:0 "Tha capital of our African colonies should be heavily invested into, so that we bring it more in line with the proper degree of industrialisation for the day."
 HOL_reinforce_jav:0 "Reinforce Leopoldville"
 HOL_reinforce_jav_desc:0 "Leopoldville houses the largest part of the African population and industry, as well as its capital and all the major military bases and headquarters. Consequently, it is by far the most important island of the East Indies, and we should improve its defenses to ensure we can remain in control of it even if all else is lost."
 HOL_the_foundations_of_defense:0 "The "Foundations of Defense""
 HOL_the_foundations_of_defense_desc:0 "The "Defensiegrondslagen van Nederlands-Indië" was a report drafted in 1927, analyzing the defensibility of our colonies. With the recent increase in Japanese aggression, and knowing full well their designs on the East Indies, perhaps this document should be dusted off, and the defensive weak points it identifies prioritized for the allocation of our newly freed-up resources."

 HOL_curtail_colonial_autonomy:0 "Curtail Colonial Autonomy"
 HOL_curtail_colonial_autonomy_desc:0 "It may well be possible that the continental Netherlands are overrun despite our best preparations. In this case, we should look to alternatives, and one possibility would be to relocate the government to the Dutch Congo, in the city of Leopoldville. We should make it clear to our colonial administration that we may soon take direct control of their affairs, instead."
 HOL_continue_the_war_in_batavi:0 "Continue the War in Leopoldville"
 HOL_continue_the_war_in_batavi_desc:1 "The invasion we feared has come to pass, and our defenses have been swept aside. The government has managed to escape and is now in exile, hosted by our allies. Though our Queen would rather that the government remain in exile and 'close to the action' in Europe, we think the time has come to relocate to Leopoldville, and from there continue the war as a sovereign power."

 HOL_expand_the_colonial_army_desc:0 "One thing the East Indies do not lack is manpower. By whichever concessions and promises we are required to make, we must make service in the army more attractive, while also making it clear that new colonial recruits are the only defense the islands have against the greed of the Japanese."
 HOL_colonial_shipbuilding:0 "Colonial Shipbuilding"
 HOL_colonial_shipbuilding_desc:0 "With the fall of the Netherlands, our continental shipyards were lost. We must put aside resources to create new shipyards in the East, if we are to build up our naval forces."
 HOL_the_east_indies_war_machine:0 "The East Indies War Machine"

 HOL_prepare_for_our_return:0 "Prepare for Our Return"
 HOL_prepare_for_our_return_desc:0 "We require large quantities of shipping to transport our troops back to the continent if we wish to aid in the liberation of our homeland. More shipyards and perfecting the craft of building cargo ships should see to this need."

 HOL_abandon_the_gold_standard:0 "Abandon the Gold Standard"
 HOL_abandon_the_gold_standard_desc:0 "Refusing to drop the Gold Standard has cost us tremendous resources these past years. Now that France has left the Gold Bloc, only the Swiss and ourselves remain. The time has come to allow the devaluation of the Guilder, and to use the freed-up resources to improve the sorry state of our defenses."
 HOL_continue_the_public_works:0 "Continue the Public Works"
 HOL_continue_the_public_works_desc:1 "We must continue the great public works started in the late 1920s. The reclamation of land and the construction of new canals, roads, and tunnels not only creates jobs, but also serves to improve the nation."
 HOL_finish_the_noordoostpolder:0 "Finish the Noordoostpolder"
 HOL_finish_the_noordoostpolder_desc:0 "After closing off the Zuiderzee by building the Afsluitdijk, and thereby creating the artificial IJsselmeer lake, we must now finish the land reclamation project of the Noordoostpolder. This will give us better infrastructure and more room for industrial and agricultural expansion."
 HOL_the_maastunnel:0 "The Maastunnel"
 HOL_the_maastunnel_desc:0 "Our great rivers are phenomenal obstacles, but by digging tunnels under them we can drastically improve our infrastructure. The Maastunnel will be the first of these, greatly improving accessibility to the city of Rotterdam from the south."

 HOL_the_zuiderzee_works_desc:0 "The next stage of land reclamation is the Flevopolder, named after the ancient Flevo lake first mentioned in Roman times. This is a tremendous project that will take many years to be fully finished, but even in the short term it will provide us with ample rewards."
 HOL_develop_the_randstad:0 "Develop the Randstad"
 HOL_develop_the_randstad_desc:0 "By developing our largest cities and the areas connecting them even further, we can lay the foundations of what some are already starting to refer to as the 'Rim City'; a roughly circular urban area connecting the major cities of Amsterdam, Den Haag, Rotterdam, and Utrecht, surrounding the 'Groene Hart' or 'Green Heart' at the center of the 'rim'."

 HOL_fokker:0 "Fokker"
 HOL_fokker_desc:0 "Fokker, the world leader in civil aircraft production, has been jumping at the chance to build more military aircraft. Perhaps we should let them, and support the enlargement of the industry that this requires."

 HOL_domestic_jet_engine_designs:0 "Domestic Jet Engine Designs"
 HOL_domestic_jet_engine_designs_desc:0 "Our innovative aircraft builders should be encouraged to experiment with futuristic designs. Though the result may not immediately be a functioning jet engine aircraft, it will undoubtedly result in improvements in production of aircraft in general."
 HOL_develop_the_zandstad:0 "Develop the Zandstad"
 HOL_develop_the_zandstad_desc:0 "Rather than focus all of our efforts in building up our largest cities, we should distribute new industry more among the outlying areas."

 HOL_daf:0 "DAF"
 HOL_daf_desc:1 "Our domestic car industry is not non-existent, and could well be contracted to produce military vehicles.

 HOL_make_use_of_our_riches:0 "Make Use of Our Riches"
 HOL_make_use_of_our_riches_desc:0 "Our nation possesses the resources of a major power while wearing the garb of a minor one.

 HOL_the_ultimate_deterrent:0 "The Ultimate Deterrent"
 HOL_the_ultimate_deterrent_desc:0 "A powerful air force and a powerful navy are all nice and well, but what would truly deter anyone from attacking our colonies, or otherwise violating our neutrality, would be the development of an atomic bomb."
 HOL_overturn_military_budget_cuts:0 "Overturn Military Budget Cuts"
 HOL_overturn_military_budget_cuts_desc:0 "The economy has begun recovering surprisingly quickly after we abandoned the Gold Standard... The military budget cuts we were forced to implement to keep the Guilder from devaluating can now be overturned."
 HOL_prepare_the_inundation_lines:0 "Prepare the Inundation Lines"
 HOL_prepare_the_inundation_lines_desc:0 "Ever since our independence war against the Spanish in the 16th century, inundation, or intentional flooding of the land, has been an integral part of our defenses.

 HOL_southward_defenses:0 "Southward Defenses"
 HOL_southward_defenses_desc:0 "We must establish a defensive line along the Meuse river, to thwart any northward push through Belgium. A further, final strengthening of our coastal defenses should definitively smash any potential British plans to land an expeditionary force in our harbors."

 HOL_fortress_holland_desc:0 "We must bet everything on Fortress Holland. The area north of the great rivers and west of the IJsselmeer encompasses by far the larger part of our population and industry. Sacrificing the rest of the country might allow us to hold out long enough in our industrialized area for a more powerful ally to come to our aid in time."

 HOL_war_on_pacifism:0 "War on Pacifism"
 HOL_war_on_pacifism_desc:0 "Ever since the Great War, pacifism has run rampant among the Dutch public, making it practically impossible to form a modern military.

We will declare a war upon Pacifism, and banish this unproductive sentiment from the minds of our populace!"

 HOL_production_under_license:0 "Production Under License"

 HOL_secret_staff_talks:0 "Secret Staff Talks"
 HOL_secret_staff_talks_desc:0 "Though we are officially neutral, we should nevertheless look into secret staff talks with our neighbors. Concerted defensive plans worked out with any one of our neighbors, even if unofficial, could be of monumental importance if we are invaded by another."

 HOL_anti_tank_guns_for_the_continent:0 "Anti Tank Guns for the Continent"
 HOL_anti_tank_guns_for_the_continent_desc:0 "Since the Great War we have seen our continental neighbors improve their tank designs. If invasion comes, these machines will certainly be an integral part of it. We must prepare accordingly."

 HOL_strategic_bombing_defense_desc:0 "If war should come to the Netherlands, it will surely involve strategic bombing on the largest scale imaginable.

 HOL_unsinkable_aircraft_carriers:0 "Unsinkable Aircraft Carriers"
 HOL_unsinkable_aircraft_carriers_desc:0 "With the advent of the third dimension of warfare we should see to ensuring adequate air cover for our fleet. However, mere steel, sinkable aircraft carriers are such a fickle investment... Rather, the thousands of islands sprawling across the East Indies could serve as "unsinkable aircraft carriers", if only we were to put some air fields on them."
 HOL_aviatic_aspirations:0 "Aviatic Aspirations"
 HOL_aviatic_aspirations_desc:0 "The air is a new theater of war, but not one we cannot master. We already have shown our ability when it comes to the civilian aviation industry, surely it will not be so hard to transfer that to the military sphere, as well."

 HOL_expand_the_papua_petroleum_harbor_desc:0 "An increase in the size of our navy requires a comparable increase in the size of our fuel stores, lest we are left with ships that we cannot afford to use.

A United States of Europe might some day prevent catastrophes such as the Great War, but by forming a loose union with our southern neighbors we can provide the core of such an organization already today."

 HOL_responsibility_for_our_own_defense_desc:0 "Without any major powers to rely on, we have no choice but to see to our own defenses, and take full responsibility for ensuring that they are adequate to whatever challenge may be thrown against them."

 HOL_lessons_from_the_low_countries_desc:0 "As the neutral land between two major powers, the Low Countries have seen their share of warfare. We must draw our lessons from this, and be prepared for even more invasions, as one neighbor attempts to flatten us once again in order to reach the other."

 HOL_foundations_for_a_european_union_desc:0 "From the humble beginnings of our Benelux we must forge a continent-wide Union of Nations, standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the face of the incessant warmongering of the major powers. A European Union will secure peace and prosperity for all."

 HOL_the_best_defense_desc:0 "We must not be caught unawares as we have been in previous wars. If our neighbors will not listen to reason and settle for peace, then we must make them."
 HOL_wilhelmina:0 "Wilhelmina"
 HOL_wilhelmina_desc:0 "For centuries the family of Orange-Nassau has been interwoven with the very history of the Netherlands itself. Like her forefather William the Silent in the Eighty Years' War, the current Queen, Wilhelmina, will undoubtedly prove an inspiration for Dutchmen rallying to the defense of their homeland, should their country ever be invaded."
 HOL_aloof_neutralit:0 "Aloof Neutrality"
 HOL_aloof_neutralit_desc:0 "A policy of strict Neutrality has kept the Dutch out of wars with any of its neighbours for nearly 150 years, and, above all, has kept them out of the Great War. The public's belief in their "talisman of protection" is therefore almost fervent, and the weak Dutch government finds itself unable to go against the will of the people and take a strong stand in international politics. Instead, it has resolved to put its faith in the League of Nations, and otherwise adopts an aloof attitude to world events."
 HOL_shell_shocked_spectator:0 "Shell-shocked Spectator of the Great War"
 HOL_shell_shocked_spectator_desc:1 "As the neutral Netherlands was the closest safe haven for refugees from the Western Front, the Dutch have been but all too close a spectator to the horrors of the Great War. As a result, a strong pacifist movement has grown to permeate large parts of the public, and presents the government with great difficulties in implementing any increase of military expenditure. Only the navy still enjoys a certain measure of prestige in the public eye.\n\nA defensive war or a "war on pacifism" would be needed to truly rid the country of this sentiment."
 HOL_de_crisisjaren:0 "De Crisisjaren"
 HOL_de_crisisjaren_desc:1 "Due to the peculiarities of global economics, the Great Depression has hit in the Netherlands much later than elsewhere. The Dutch decision to maintain the Gold Standard, while other nations abandoned it rather quickly, has further exacerbated the "crisis years" in the Netherlands tremendously. In keeping the Guilder from devaluating, no funds are left to aid the ailing Dutch economy, let alone improve the poor state of national defenses.\n\nThe crisis can be reduced by investing in public works, and will become largely irrelevant if we capitulate and lose control of the crisis-stricken mainland."

 HOL_caved_to_the_germans_idea_desc:0 "Rather than face the threat of invasion, the Dutch have elected to concede to German demands in their trade negotiations. Democratic freedom has begun to suffer as a result, and this could be seen as the first tentative step away from neutrality."

 HOL_caved_to_the_british_idea_desc:0 "Rather than face the threat of total blockade, which would certainly have spelled economic disaster, the Dutch have elected to concede to the British demands in their trade negotiations. Anti-German and pro-British sentiments are increasingly becoming noticeable in the country's internal politics, and this could be seen as the first tentative step away from neutrality."
